<h1>Every number has a prime factorization</h1>
<h2 class="no-deps"> Dependencies: None </h2>
<div class="horizontal-rule"></div>
<p>Every positive number has a prime factorization.</p>
<h2>Proof</h2>
<p>Let $n$ be the smallest number without a prime factorization.
1 has the empty factorization. Therefore, $n \ge 2$.</p>
<p>Also, $n$ is not prime, so it can be written as a product of factors other than 1 and itself.
Therefore, all its factors have a prime factorization.
Therefore, $n$ also has a prime factorization.
This is a contradiction, which means all numbers have a prime factorization.</p>
