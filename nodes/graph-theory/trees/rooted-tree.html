<p>A directed graph $G$ is a <strong>rooted tree</strong> iff there is a vertex $r$, called the <strong>root</strong>,
such that there is a unique simple path from $r$ to every vertex in $G$.</p>
<p>The root has in-degree 0. Every other vertex has in-degree 1,
otherwise there would be multiple paths to it from the root.</p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>Let $T$ be a rooted tree.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is an edge $(u, v)$ in $T$,
then $v$ is a <strong>child</strong> of $u$ and $u$ is the <strong>parent</strong> of $v$.</li>
<li>If there is a path of positive length from $u$ to $v$ in $T$,
then $v$ is a <strong>descendent</strong> of $u$ and $u$ is an <strong>ancestor</strong> of $v$.</li>
<li>A vertex with out-degree 0 is called a <strong>leaf</strong>.
A vertex that is not a leaf is called an <strong>internal vertex</strong>.</li>
<li>If 2 vertices have the same parent, they are called <strong>siblings</strong>.</li>
<li>The subgraph of $T$ containing $v$ and all its descendents
is a tree rooted at $v$. This is called the <strong>subtree of $T$ rooted at $v$</strong>.</li>
<li>For a vertex $v$, let the length of the path from the root be $k$.
Then the <strong>depth</strong> of $v$ is $k$.</li>
<li>The <strong>height</strong> of a vertex is the length of the longest path from it to a leaf.
The height of a rooted tree is the height of its root.</li>
</ul>
