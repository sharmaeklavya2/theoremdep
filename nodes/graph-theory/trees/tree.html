<p>There are 2 ways of defining a <strong>free tree</strong> (sometimes simply called <strong>tree</strong>):</p>
<ul>
<li>An undirected acyclic connected graph.</li>
<li>An undirected graph where there is exactly one simple path between any two vertices.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a tree, vertices of degree 1 are called <strong>leaves</strong>.</p>
<h2>Proof of equivalence of definitions</h2>
<p>Let $G$ be an undirected graph.
We will prove the contrapositive, that if $G$ is cyclic or disconnected,
then it is false that there is exactly one simple path between any 2 vertices.</p>
<p>If $G$ is disconnected, there are 2 vertices which are not connected.
There are 0 paths between these vertices.</p>
<p>Let $G$ be cyclic. Let $u$ and $v$ be 2 vertices on a cycle in $G$.
This means there are at least 2 simple paths from $u$ to $v$.</p>
<p>If there are 0 paths from $u$ to $v$,
then $u$ and $v$ are disconnected, which means $G$ is disconnected.</p>
<p>Let there be multiple simple paths from $u$ to $v$.
Let $p_1$ and $p_2$ be 2 such paths.
Let $w_1$ and $w_2$ be the first and second vertices common to $p_1$ and $p_2$
when going from $u$ to $v$.
Then $w_1$ and $w_2$ form a cycle.
Therefore, $G$ is cyclic.</p>
