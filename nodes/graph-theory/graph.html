<h1>Graph</h1>
<h2 class="no-deps"> Dependencies: None </h2>

<div class="horizontal-rule"></div>
<p>A directed graph $G$ is the pair $(V, E)$, where $E$ contains some ordered pairs on $V$.
I.e. $E \subseteq V \times V$.</p>
<p>An undirected graph $G$ is the pair $(V, E)$, where $E$ contains some 2-element subsets of $V$.
These subsets are often denoted as $(u, v)$ instead of $\{u, v\}$.</p>
<p>When $E$ is allowed to be a multi-set (a set which can have repeated elements),
we get directed multigraphs or undirected multigraphs.</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<ul>
<li>$V$ is called the set of <strong>vertices</strong>.</li>
<li>$E$ is called the set of <strong>edges</strong>.</li>
<li>If $(u, v) \in E$, then $u$ is <strong>adjacent to</strong> $v$ and $v$ is <strong>adjacent to</strong> $u$.
$u$ and $v$ are said to be <strong>neighbors</strong>.</li>
<li>The edge $(u, v)$ is called a <strong>loop</strong> iff $u = v$.
A graph with no loops is called <strong>loop-free</strong> or <strong>simple</strong>.</li>
<li>$G' = (V', E')$ is a <strong>subgraph</strong> of $G = (V, E)$ (denoted as $G' \subseteq G$) iff
$G'$ is a graph and $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$.</li>
<li>If $G = (V, E)$ and $V' \subseteq V$, the <strong>subgraph of $G$ induced by $V'$</strong>
is the subgraph $G' = (V', E \cap (V' \times V'))$.</li>
<li>An <strong>edge-labeled</strong> graph is a graph where each edge has a corresponding <strong>label</strong>.
When the labels are numbers, the labels are called <strong>weights</strong> and the graph
is said to be <strong>edge-weighted</strong> (or simply weighted).
The weight of the edge $(u, v)$ is generally denoted as $w(u, v)$.</li>
<li>A <strong>vertex-labeled</strong> graph is a graph where each vertex has a corresponding <strong>label</strong>.
When the labels are numbers, the labels are called <strong>weights</strong> and the graph
is said to be <strong>vertex-weighted</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Definitions for directed graphs</h4>
<ul>
<li>The edge $(u, v)$ is <strong>from $u$ to $v$</strong>.</li>
<li>For $e = (u, v) \in E$, $u$ and $v$ are <strong>endpoints</strong> of $e$.
  $u$ is the <strong>source</strong> of $e$ and $v$ is the <strong>destination</strong> or <strong>target</strong> of $v$.</li>
<li>$e = (u, v) \in E$ means $e$ is<ul>
<li><strong>incident from</strong> $u$.</li>
<li><strong>incident to</strong> $v$.</li>
<li><strong>incident on</strong> $u$ and $v$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The number of edges incident to $v$ is the <strong>in-degree</strong> of $v$, denoted as $\operatorname{indeg}_G(v)$.</li>
<li>The number of edges incident from $v$ is the <strong>out-degree</strong> of $v$, denoted as $\operatorname{outdeg}_G(v)$.</li>
<li>The sum of in-degree and out-degree is called <strong>degree</strong>, denoted as $\deg_G(v)$.</li>
<li>The <strong>undirected version</strong> of a directed graph is an undirected graph obtained
by removing the direction of every edge in the directed graph.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Definitions for undirected graphs</h4>
<ul>
<li>The edge $(u, v)$ is <strong>between $u$ and $v$</strong>.</li>
<li>For $e = (u, v) \in E$, $u$ and $v$ are <strong>endpoints</strong> of $e$.</li>
<li>$e = (u, v) \in E$ means $e$ is <strong>incident on</strong> $u$ and $v$.</li>
<li>The number of edges incident on $v$ is called the <strong>degree</strong> of $v$,
denoted as $\operatorname{deg}_G(v)$.</li>
<li>The <strong>directed version</strong> of an undirected graph $G$ is the directed graph
which contains both $(u, v)$ and $(v, u)$ for every edge $(u, v)$ in $G$.</li>
</ul>
