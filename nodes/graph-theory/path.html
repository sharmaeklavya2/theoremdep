<p>For a graph $G = (V, E)$, a <strong>walk</strong> of length $n$ is a sequence of vertices $[v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n]$
such that $\forall 1 \le i \le n, (v_{i-1}, v_i) \in E$.
Such a walk is said to be 'from $v_0$ to $v_n$'.
The length of a path is generally denoted as $|w|$.</p>
<p>The <strong>reverse</strong> of a path $[v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n]$ is the path $[v_n, v_{n-1}, \ldots, v_0]$.</p>
<p>If $p_1 = [v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n]$ and $p_2 = [v_n, v_{n+1}, \ldots, v_{m+n}]$ are walks,
then the <strong>concatenation</strong> of $p_1$ and $p_2$, denoted as $p_1 + p_2$ or $p_1p_2$ is the path
$[v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{m+n}]$.</p>
<p>If a walk $p$ is from a vertex $v$ to itself, $p$ can be <strong>concatenated to itself</strong>.
For a non-negative integer $k$, $kp$ (or $p^k$) is the path $p + p + \ldots + p$ ($k$ times).
For $k=0$, $kp$ is a path from $v$ to $v$ of length 0.
This means that $|kp| = k|p|$.</p>
<p>In a weighted graph, the <strong>weight</strong> of a walk $p$, denoted as $w(p)$,
is the sum of weights of edges of $p$.
In an unweighted graph, the weight of a walk is the number of edges in it.
A walk $p$ is called a negative-weight walk iff $w(p) &lt; 0$.</p>
<p>A <strong>simple path</strong> is a walk where $v_i \neq v_j$ for all $(i, j)$.</p>
<p>A <strong>path</strong> can refer to either a walk or a simple path, depending on the author.</p>
<p>If $p = [v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n]$ is a path then
$q = [v_i, v_{i+1}, \ldots, v_{j}]$ is a <strong>subpath</strong> of $p$.</p>
<p>A <strong>shortest-path</strong> generally refers to a walk with the smallest weight.
The weight of a shortest path between $u$ and $v$ in $G$ is denoted as $\delta_G(u, v)$.
If there is no path from $u$ to $v$, $\delta_G(u, v) = \infty$.
If there is no lower bound on the weight of a path from $u$ to $v$
(this can happen, for example, if $u$ and $v$ lie on a cycle whose edges have negative weights),
then $\delta_G(u, v) = -\infty$.
This means that a shortest path exists between $u$ and $v$
iff $\delta_G(u, v) \neq \infty$ and $\delta_G(u, v) \neq -\infty$.</p>
<p>A <strong>circuit</strong> is a walk of positive length (not necessarily positive weight) where $v_0 = v_n$.
A <strong>cycle</strong> is a simple path of positive length (not necessarily positive weight) except that $v_0 = v_n$.
A graph with no cycles is called <strong>acyclic</strong>.</p>
<p>If a walk exists from $u$ to $v$, $v$ is said to be <strong>reachable</strong> from $u$.
If $u$ is reachable from $v$ and $v$ is reachable from $u$,
then $u$ and $v$ are said to be <strong>strongly-connected</strong>.</p>
<p>Theorems (rigorous proofs omitted):</p>
<ul>
<li>If a walk exists from $u$ to $v$, then a simple path also exists from $u$ to $v$.
This simple path can be obtained by removing all cycles from the path.</li>
<li>If a circuit $C$ exists in a graph, then a subgraph of $C$ exists which is a cycle.</li>
<li>Reachability is a reflexive and transitive relation.
It is reflexive because there is always a path of length 0 from a vertex to itself.
It is transitive because the path from $u$ to $w$ can be constructed by concatenating
the path from $u$ to $v$ and the path from $v$ to $w$.</li>
<li>In an undirected graph, reachability is an equivalence relation.
Reachability is symmetric here because a path from $v$ to $u$
can be obtained by reversing the path from $u$ to $v$.</li>
<li>In a directed graph, strongly-connectedness is an equivalence relation.</li>
<li>There is a walk of length $n$ from $u$ to $v$ iff $(u, v) \in E^n$
($E^n$ is the $E$ relation composed with itself $n$ times).</li>
<li>There is a walk from $u$ to $v$ iff $(u, v) \in E^*$
($E^*$ is the reflexive and transitive closure of the relation $E$).</li>
</ul>
<p>In an undirected graph, if $u$ is reachable from $v$, then $u$ and $v$ are said to be connected.
If all vertices in an undirected graph are reachable from each other, the graph is said to be <strong>connected</strong>.
If all vertices in a directed graph are reachable from each other, the graph is said to be <strong>strongly-connected</strong>.
The equivalence classes of the 'reachable' relation are called <strong>connected components</strong>.
The equivalence classes of the 'strongly-connected' relation are called <strong>strongly-connected components</strong> (SCCs).</p>
